        <h2>What is Executive Function?</h2>
        <p>
            Executive function refers to a set of mental processes that help us plan, organize, manage time, make decisions, and control our impulses. These skills are essential for achieving goals, managing daily tasks, and interacting with others effectively.

        <h3>Key Components of Executive Function</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Working Memory:</strong> The ability to hold and manipulate information temporarily, such as remembering instructions while completing a task.</li>
            <li><strong>Attention Control:</strong> The ability to focus on relevant information and filter out distractions.</li>
            <li><strong>Impulse Control:</strong> The ability to think before acting and resist immediate urges.</li>
            <li><strong>Planning and Organization:</strong> The ability to break down complex tasks into steps and arrange them in a logical order.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Management:</strong> The ability to estimate how long tasks take and prioritize activities.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The ability to adapt to changing situations and switch between tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional Regulation:</strong> The ability to manage and respond appropriately to emotions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Executive Function and ADHD</h3>
        <p>
            People with ADHD often experience challenges with executive function. Difficulties may include trouble with sustained attention, working memory, planning, organization, and impulse control. This can make it harder to manage tasks, follow through on commitments, and regulate behavior—even when the person is motivated and capable.

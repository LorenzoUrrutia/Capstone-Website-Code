    <h1>Dyscalculia</h1>

    <h2>What Dyscalculia affects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Visual processing:</strong> the ability of your eyes to take in the whole equation and send each part to the brain to sort out.</li>
      <li><strong>Short-term memory:</strong> capacity to hold numbers, symbols, and their order in mind while solving.</li>
      <li><strong>Language processing:</strong> ability to translate symbols like +, =, and ? into their meanings in the problem.</li>
      <li><strong>Long-term memory:</strong> ability to recall the steps for solving a familiar operation (like addition).</li>
      <li><strong>Number sense:</strong> ability to connect a numeral such as “2” to the idea of a specific quantity.</li>
      <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> all of these pieces combine to work out the answer (e.g., 2 + 2 = 4).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Symptoms</h2>
    <p>The symptoms of dyscalculia depend on which parts of the process a person struggles with most and the person's age.</p>

    <h4>Young children</h4>

      <li>Counting upward.</li>
      <li>Connecting a number to that many of an object: number 7 to that many blocks in front of them.</li>
      <li>Recognizing numbers and math symbols.</li>
      <li>Organizing numbers</li>
      <li>Recognizing and using number lines.</li>
      <li>Learning using money</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>School age children</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Counting on fingers with small numbers when not necessary.</li>

      <li>Memorizing multiplication tables.</li>
      <li>Recognizing the same math problem when the order of the numbers or symbols changes.</li>
      <li>Understanding word problems or more advanced symbols like "greater then" or "less than".</li>
      <li>Organizing numbers by scale (10s, 100s, 1,000s) or decimal place (0.1, 0.01, 0.001).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Teenagers and adults</h4>
    <ul>

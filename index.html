					<h1 style="text-align:center">Understanding Learning Disabilities Through Technology</h1>
					<p style="text-indent:1.5em">For a long time, I noticed how misunderstood learning disabilities are. Many students feel embarrassed to use the learning center or ask for extra help because of societal stigma.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:1.5em">These assumptions exist because schools often fail to teach what learning disabilities are and what the experience of learning with one is actually like. As a result, students who do not face these challenges may struggle to empathize with the difficulties that students with learning disabilities experience.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:1.5em">This lack of understanding can lead to students being made fun of or having their hard work discredited because of accommodations such as extra time. I have experienced this firsthand since middle school, when I was diagnosed with ADHD and a learning disability in reading, and it has continued to affect me throughout high school. Watching my peers easily focus or effortlessly read passages has impacted my self-esteem and confidence in my academic abilities. When teachers asked if everyone had finished reading, I often raised my hand just to blend in, even when I had not. Moments like these showed me how invisible learning disabilities can feel and how easily they are misunderstood by others.</p>
					<p style="text-indent:1.5em">Through this project, I hope to create a resource that helps students, educators, and anyone interested in learning disabilities to better understand these conditions. By providing interactive simulations alongside informative content, I aim to foster empathy and awareness about the challenges faced by individuals with learning disabilities.</p>

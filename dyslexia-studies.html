    <h1>Study</h1>
    <p> A study compared 10 children with dyslexia to age-matched and reading-matched control groups, using MRI and behavioral tests to identify brain differences specifically linked to dyslexia rather than just lower reading levels </p>

    <h2>Study details</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Behavioral Benchmarking:</strong> Before the scans, children took a battery of tests like Word Attack (reading fake words) and the PPVT (vocabulary) to map out their exact reading and language levels.</li>
        <li><strong>The In-Scanner Task:</strong> Participants then entered an fMRI scanner to perform a Word-Rhyme Task, where they had to decide if words like "bait" and "gate" rhymed while the machine tracked their brain activity.</li>
        <li><strong>Structural Comparisons:</strong> The team took detailed anatomical scans to measure Gray Matter Volume, confirming that any differences they found were based on how the brain functions, not its physical size or shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Quality Control:</strong> During the data analysis, they used software to account for head motion and scaled the signals to ensure the results weren't skewed by a child wiggling in the scanner.</li>
        <li><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong> Finally, they compared the brain maps across all three groups using Random-Effects Models to isolate the specific regions where dyslexic brains worked differently than both older and younger typical readers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Results</h2>
     <ul> 
        <li><strong>Left Temporoparietal Cortex:</strong> Found to be underactive in dyslexic children, impacting their ability to map letters to sounds.</li>
        <li><strong>Left Inferior Frontal Gyrus:</strong> Showed reduced activity, suggesting difficulties with the "inner speech" needed for phonological processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Occipitotemporal Cortex:</strong> Identified as less active in dyslexics, which affects their ability to quickly recognize word shapes. </li>
    </ul>
